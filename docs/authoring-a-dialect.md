# Authoring a dialect

A **dialect** is an AST-library adapter: it teaches the SDK how to parse, mutate, and print one
file type. A dialect bundles three things — file extensions, a parse/print pair, and an
**op-pack** (the mutation vocabulary an author calls on a handle).

This document covers exactly the dialect-authoring surface this SDK ships today: the generic
contract (`defineDialect`/`defineOpPack`/`withOps`), the universal `.raw()` escape hatch, and the
first real dialect, `@pbuilder/sdk/typescript`, whose op-pack has widened past its original thin
starter shape (`addImport`) to five structured ops: `addImport`, `addFunction`, `addVariable`,
`addClass`, `removeImport`.

## Two audiences

Per [ADR-0009](../openspec/decisions/0009-two-audiences-contributor-kit.md), this SDK has two
distinct audiences:

- **Authors** consume a published dialect (e.g. `@pbuilder/sdk/typescript`) inside a schematic —
  they call `find(path)` and chain ops.
- **Contributors** build a NEW dialect by calling `defineDialect`/`defineOpPack`/`withOps`.

### For authors: using a dialect

```ts
import * as ts from "@pbuilder/sdk/typescript";

await ts.find("src/index.ts").addImport("readFileSync", "node:fs");
```

`find(path)` opens a coalescing, awaitable handle. Every op you chain on it — `addImport`, or the
universal `.raw()` — mutates the SAME live AST; the handle serializes to exactly one `modify`
directive at flush (see "Coalescing" below).

`addImport(name, from)` adds `import { name } from "from";` to the file's import list, merging
into an existing named-import clause from the same module if one is already present (calling it
twice with the same name and module is idempotent — no duplicate import line).

`addFunction(name, source, options?)` inserts a new top-level function declaration at the end of
the file, in call order: `options?.export` prepends `export `. `source` INCLUDES the function's
`{ … }` braces — the full signature-and-body text, e.g. `"(): void {}"` for
`function hi(): void {}` — a deliberate contrast with `addClass`'s `source`, which EXCLUDES its
braces (that op supplies them itself). `addFunction` REJECTS when a value declaration
(`function`/`const`/`let`/`var`/`class`) or an import binding already exists under `name` —
imports MERGE (safe, multiple modules can share a name), but two value declarations sharing a
name produce invalid TypeScript, so this op fails loud instead of silently colliding. A
`type`/`interface` under the same name does NOT collide (TypeScript legally permits a value and a
type to share an identifier).

```ts
// source includes braces:
await ts.find("src/index.ts").addFunction("hi", "(): void {}", { export: true });
// -> export function hi(): void {}
// contrast addClass, whose source EXCLUDES braces (the op adds them itself).
```

`addVariable(name, initializer, options?)` inserts a new top-level variable declaration at the end
of the file, in call order: `{export }{kind} {name} = {initializer};`. `options?.kind` defaults to
`"const"` (also accepts `"let"`/`"var"`); `options?.export` prepends `export `. Rejects under the
SAME collision rule as `addFunction` — a value declaration or import binding already existing
under `name` fails loud; `type`/`interface` do not collide.

```ts
await ts.find("src/index.ts").addVariable("counter", "0", { export: true, kind: "let" });
// -> export let counter = 0;
```

`addClass(name, source, options?)` inserts a new top-level class declaration at the end of the
file, in call order: `{export }class {name} {\n{source}\n}`. `source` EXCLUDES the class's
`{ … }` braces — the op supplies them itself, a deliberate contrast with `addFunction`'s `source`,
which INCLUDES its braces. Rejects under the SAME collision rule as `addFunction`.

```ts
// source excludes braces:
await ts.find("src/index.ts").addClass("Point", "  x = 0;");
// -> class Point {\n  x = 0;\n}
// contrast addFunction, whose source INCLUDES braces (the op does NOT add them itself).
```

`addFunction`'s/`addVariable`'s/`addClass`'s `source`/`initializer` strings are inserted
VERBATIM — never validated or sanitized. The author owns their own syntax, the same trust
contract `.raw()` carries.

`removeImport(name, from)` removes the named binding from `from`'s import clause. Idempotent:
removing an ABSENT binding is a no-op (zero directives emitted) — mirrors `addImport`'s own
idempotency. Removing the LAST remaining named binding in an import clause deletes the entire
import statement — no dangling `import {} from "from"`. An aliased specifier
(`{ readFileSync as rf }`) is matched by the module-EXPORTED name (`readFileSync`), not the local
alias `rf`. Scope: NAMED-binding imports only — default and namespace imports are out of scope
for this op.

A dialect handle's `.modify(content)` REJECTS when an AST-op directive (any named op, or `.raw()`)
is still OPEN — buffered, not yet drained by a read or flush — on the SAME handle: the pending AST
edit would otherwise be silently lost to `.modify()`'s own raw overwrite. This is asymmetric and
narrowly scoped: `.modify()` with no AST op pending is unaffected; an AST op enqueued AFTER
`.modify()` is unaffected (the restriction is directional); and `.read()` is the documented
escape — it drains the pending AST op first, so `.modify()` called AFTER a `.read()` is a
legitimate sequential edit, not a collision:

```ts
const handle = ts.find("src/index.ts").addImport("readFileSync", "node:fs");
await handle.read(); // drains the pending addImport edit
handle.modify("new content"); // succeeds — the documented escape
```

### For contributors: building a dialect

A dialect is assembled from three kit verbs:

- **`defineDialect(descriptor)`** — assembles a `Dialect` from a frozen descriptor: `extensions`
  (file-extension matchers), `ast: { parse, print }` (the AST parse/print pair), and `ops` (the
  dialect's own op-pack, `{}` if none). A 5th descriptor field is a compile error — the shape is
  frozen. See its JSDoc `@example` in `src/core/define-dialect.ts` for a runnable snippet.
- **`defineOpPack(ops)`** — declares a named record of ops over one AST type, usable standalone
  (shareable across dialects targeting the same AST type) before any `withOps` composition. See
  its JSDoc `@example` in `src/core/define-dialect.ts`.
- **`withOps(base, ...packs)`** — composes additional op-packs onto a base dialect; the resulting
  handle type is the INTERSECTION of the base's ops and every attached pack's ops. An op from an
  unattached pack, or a typo, is a compile error. See its JSDoc `@example` in
  `src/core/define-dialect.ts`. At composition time, `withOps` also runs an eager, synchronous,
  fail-closed check: an op name declared by two or more of the passed packs (or colliding with
  the base dialect's own ops) throws immediately, naming the colliding op — composition never
  silently resolves to whichever pack happened to be spread last. An op name that shadows the
  base handle's own vocabulary (`then`, `read`, `raw`, `modify`, `rename`, `move`, `copy`,
  `remove`) throws the same way — an op-pack op named `then` in particular would break the
  handle's `PromiseLike` join.

A contributor's worked proof anchors are the conformance kit — `testDialect`/`testOpPack`
(`@pbuilder/sdk/conformance`) — which asserts a dialect's parse/print round-trip, per-op
fidelity, and coalescing are honest, and the type-level composition proof: an `expectTypeOf` pin
on `withOps`'s intersection type (`test/types/define-dialect.test.ts`), which fails to compile if
op-pack composition regresses.

## The `.raw()` escape hatch

Every dialect handle carries one universal op alongside its named ops: `.raw(ast => { ... })`. It
hands your callback the SAME live AST instance the named ops mutate — anything a named op could
do, `.raw()` can do too, without waiting for a structured op to exist.

`.raw()` executes your callback with full process privilege — it is not a sandbox. Read
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) before importing any third-party dialect or op-pack that uses it.

### Two ts-morph realms

Two ts-morph realms: if your schematic already depends on ts-morph directly, that is a separate realm from the SDK's internal ts-morph used inside `.raw(ast => …)`. A `Node`/`SourceFile` from your realm is not interchangeable with the AST the SDK hands your `.raw()` callback — even when both realms resolve the identical ts-morph version. Never pass ts-morph objects across the boundary; operate only on the `ast` the callback receives.

## Coalescing: how edits become one `modify`

Every op you chain on a handle — named or `.raw()` — mutates the SAME live AST instance the
handle's first op parsed. The handle's buffered `modify` directive holds a lazy, memoized
`content` getter that prints the AST exactly once, at the flush that drains it: N chained edits
with no read between them collapse into exactly ONE `modify` directive.

A read (`.read()`, or any `Session.read` on ANY path — the flush is global) drains the open
directive before returning: the handle detects this by identity and re-registers a FRESH
directive for any further edits. A chain with one mid-chain read therefore produces exactly TWO
`modify` directives, cumulative — no edit is lost.

## Async usage

The handle returned by a dialect's `find(path)` is the first **thenable** object on the author
surface — an ergonomic departure from the SDK's other, synchronous author verbs, inherent to an
async read-through-parse.

**Awaited-chain form** — the normal way to use a dialect:

```ts
await ts.find("src/index.ts").addImport("readFileSync", "node:fs");
```

`await` is not required for correctness, though: the run boundary drains every outstanding
handle before the run flushes, so a forgotten `await` still completes and commits its edit at run
end. `await` on the author side only sequences reads for read-your-own-writes — it does not
gate whether the edit lands.

A **forgotten-await** chain that throws still surfaces its error, contained, at the run boundary
— never as an unhandled rejection. If you need to observe or handle a dialect failure locally,
`await` the chain (or a promise derived from it) inside your own `try`/`catch`.

This containment is not `.raw()`-specific: a NAMED op (`addImport`, `addFunction`, `addVariable`,
`addClass`, `removeImport`, or a third-party dialect's own op) that throws synchronously, or whose
implementation is itself `async` and rejects, is contained exactly the same way — never an
unhandled rejection, always the pinned error shape.

The contained error intentionally carries no cause or stack from inside your `.raw()` body or a
named op's own implementation — `.cause` is always absent. To debug what went wrong, log from
inside the op or callback itself.

## Testing with the conformance kit

`@pbuilder/sdk/conformance` exports `testDialect(fixture)` and `testOpPack(fixture)`. Both are
`async` — they drive a real coalescing run and return a rejected promise on failure, never a
sync throw.

- `testDialect({ dialect, samples })` asserts your dialect's `parse`/`print` pair round-trips
  every sample byte-exact. `testDialect` also injects six mandatory adversarial samples on
  every run — empty, comment-only, a 4 MiB file, CRLF line endings, a UTF-8 BOM, and two
  imports sharing one module — that your dialect's `parse`/`print` must round-trip byte-exact.
  There is no opt-out: the fixture type carries no field to disable them. Before each
  round-trip it rejects a stub/identity `parse` (one that returns nothing or hands back the
  input string), so an identity dialect cannot pass vacuously.
- `testOpPack({ opPack, baseDialect, exercises })` applies each `OpExercise` (a seed, an op
  chain, and the expected byte-exact output) against the real coalescing pipeline, asserting
  per-op fidelity, coalescing-to-one, and seam-serializability. It runs those same six
  mandatory samples against your `baseDialect` too, after your exercises pass.

Passing the conformance kit (`@pbuilder/sdk/conformance`) is not a security attestation: it proves a dialect keeps the seam serializable and its ops faithful, not that the dialect's `.raw()` code is safe to execute.

## The leaf rule: dialect isolation

A dialect's `parse`/`print` pair and its ops MUST NOT import another dialect's package, and
`@pbuilder/sdk/commons` MUST NOT import any AST library (ts-morph or otherwise) — dialects and
op-packs are leaves in the dependency graph, never depending on one another.

**Documented limit**: the conformance kit's in-memory run vehicle cannot perform a full static
import-graph analysis the way a source-tree fitness function can, so it does not ship a
runtime or static scanner for this rule. `testDialect`/`testOpPack` do not check it. Third-party
dialect authors are expected to self-run their OWN static check (e.g. an import-graph lint over
their package's source) to enforce leaf-isolation locally — this is a real, documented gap for
third-party dialects, not a silently-skipped guarantee.

The SDK's own shipped `@pbuilder/sdk/typescript` dialect IS proven leaf-isolated today — by the
PRE-EXISTING `FIT-01` transitive import-graph walk in this repo's own test suite
(`test/fitness/fit-01-commons-no-ast.test.ts`), which asserts `src/commons/**` reaches no bare
AST-library import at any transitive depth. That proof lives in the fitness-function suite, not
inside `@pbuilder/sdk/conformance` — nothing under `src/conformance/**` re-implements or
duplicates it.

## Publishing and trust

Read [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) before publishing or importing a dialect or op-pack: importing
any dialect or op-pack runs its code with full process privilege, and there is no sandbox or
signing in v1.
