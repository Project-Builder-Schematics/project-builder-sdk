## From `typed-options-and-read` (2026-06-24) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| JD test-hardening (low): `permissive-proof.guard.test.ts` — derive the red-proof simulated line from `idiom2Lines[0]` instead of hardcoded 57; tighten `parseDiagnostics` regex / `fileMatch` for path-collision robustness (theoretical) | refactor | XS | — | **1.6** |
| CQ-2: real end-to-end typed-factory example (actual schema type, real options object, real file) vs synthetic matrix in `typed-create.test.ts` | docs | S | — | **4.4** |

> Note: `typecheck:permissive-proof` masked-exit followup (from #1 skeleton archive) is DONE — resolved by `permissive-proof.guard.test.ts` in this change. Removed from pending.

> **Retired 2026-07-06 (stage-2-error-attribution archive)**: the "read not-found is a VALUE
> (ADR-0016)" forward note is HONORED (design treated not-found as a value; `classifyContent`
> shipped); CQ-1 read-trichotomy is RETIRED — S-004 shipped `classifyContent` + `ContentState`
> (`openspec/specs/read-trichotomy-helper/`), not dropped.

### Fake-semantics questions (REFRAMED 2026-07-04 — was "resolve against the real engine")

The problem statement makes the contract fake the **legitimate counterpart**, so these can no
longer defer to a real engine. **★ DECISION D1 is RATIFIED — ADR-0017** (fail-closed; `move`
gains `force?`; `modify` requires existence). Stage 1.3 closes the fake to match.

| Question | Stage |
|---|---|
| Fake `move` silently overwrites an existing destination — ratified fail-closed + `force` (ADR-0017) | **1.3 (implement)** |
| Fake `modify` of a non-existent path materializes the file — ratified as ERROR (ADR-0017) | **1.3 (implement)** |

## From `stage-1-ir-bedrock` (2026-07-05) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (1.2 verify follow-up) Extract shared `EngineClient` spy helper — duplicated across `test/golden-ir/chained-batch.test.ts` (`makeSpy`) and `test/golden-ir/determinism.test.ts` (inline) — create `test/support` helper | refactor | XS | — | **1.7 (backlog)** |

## From `stage-2-error-attribution` (2026-07-06) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

Verify verdict `pass-with-followups`. Verify-final followup #1 (FIT-04 `DTS_PAIRS` pairs for
`core.authoring-error.d.ts` + `commons.classify-content.d.ts`) was **CLOSED IN-CHANGE** by
commit `6c136aa`, confirmed by verify-in-loop-4 and the amended architecture audit — recorded
here as completed, NOT pending.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EmitRejection port conformance for the real engine client: a directive-level code without in-range `failedIndex` yields a malformed public message ("undefined failed at undefined: …") and a spurious index on batch-level codes contradicts REQ-14.3 (judgment-day CONFIRMED theoretical, both judges). Enforce the precondition in the client, or degrade to `reason: "unknown"` in `toAuthoringError`. The convention is baseline-recorded and binds the real engine client (ADR-0022 revisit) — **RE-TAGGED away from Stage 6 (`stage-6-release-shape`, 2026-07-14, REQ-AOD-09.2): no real `EngineClient` exists in this repo**. **SPLIT 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client` S-005.4, REQ-LED-01)**: a real `EngineClient` now exists (`StdioEngineClient`) — its `reconstructEmitRejection` (`src/transport/stdio-engine-client.ts`) enforces EXACTLY this precondition (a directive-level code without a valid `failedIndex` degrades to `reason: "unknown"`, never a spurious index) — the SDK-SIDE half is DELIVERED. The engine-side complement (`SystemError`/`DeveloperError` → wire error shape mapping) stays cross-repo debt, unchanged | edge-case | M | Cross-repo — engine ADR-0022 revisit (PC-PROTO-01); SDK-side closed | **PARTIAL — SDK-side delivered (`stdio-engine-client`); engine-side mapping remains engine repo, cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |
| Positive type pins for `AuthoringError["verb"]`/`["path"]` `\| undefined` arms (`expectTypeOf`), + optional frozen pre-change baseline snapshot pattern for FIT-04 in-change regen blindness (Judge A + Judge B convergent) | refactor | S | test-only | **2 (hardening backlog)** |
| `primaryPath` source-side on rename/move/copy collisions points the author at the non-colliding path (ratified design §4.3; DX wart) — revisit whether the dialect family surfaces the colliding destination before the message contract ossifies further | other | S | — | **5 (note)** |
| `defineFactory` silently drops factory return values — plausible author mistake with zero signal today (steward) | edge-case | S | DX telemetry | **backlog** |
| Promote REQ-16 tags into the 4 untagged non-site source comments so the doc-discoverability pin can become a pure source scan (S-003 note) | refactor | S | — | **backlog (cleanup)** |
| (re-registered from stage-1) non-Error E1 + rejecting `discard()` silently drops E2 — `context.ts` double-fault machinery deliberately untouched this change (REQ-16 non-site, PM tripwire document-only) | edge-case | S | Non-blocking | **still-open** |
| (re-deferred from stage-1) round-trip/cap rejection messages could name the offending directive/field and non-finite value family | docs | S | — | **nice-to-have** |

## From `stage-3-dry-run-exposure` planning (2026-07-06) — registered at steward foresight

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~(steward CQ-2, owner-ratified) Demo-moment narrative restructure: the objectives-plan end-state demo interleaves a dialect read BEFORE showing the dry-run plan — under eager-flush that shows a PARTIAL plan. Restructure the demo to call `dryRun()` before any read/dialect-open~~ **RETIRED — `stage-6-release-shape`** (2026-07-14) — S-005 reordered `openspec/objectives-plan.md`'s demo-moment paragraph (REQ-AOD-10) | docs | XS | ~~When Stage 5/6 materialize the demo~~ | ~~**6.3**~~ **closed** |
| ~~(design ADR-0026) Outside-run error enumeration omits `dryRun` — generalise the `context.ts` message (post-stage-2 shape: `AuthoringError` constructor prose) while preserving the pinned "…can only be used while a schematic is running…" substring~~ **DONE 2026-07-13 (`schematic-local-files` final-verify remediation, ITEM 7)** — `messageFor`'s `outside-run` template dropped the `(create, find, modify, remove, rename, move, copy)` enumeration entirely (now: "authoring verbs can only be used…"), so it covers `dryRun` and every future verb without a per-verb edit; pinned substring preserved byte-for-byte, no test changed | refactor | XS | ~~After stage-2 AND stage-3 merge~~ | ~~**post-merge**~~ **closed** |
| (design ADR-0024/0025) Single-source extraction: wire→author verb map + `DryRunVerb`/`AuthoringVerb` union duplicated across `src/dry-run/plan.ts` and `src/core/authoring-error.ts` by deliberate no-coupling rule — extract to one home once both stages are merged. Includes hoisting stage-3's mid-file imports in `src/commons/index.ts` to the top cluster (architect note) | refactor | S | After stage-2 AND stage-3 merge | **post-merge** |
| (archive 2026-07-07, judgment-day Judge A) Test hardening: REQ-DRE-02 `.d.ts` scans in `test/skeleton/dry-run-public-contract.test.ts` target the COMMITTED baseline, not fresh `dist/` output — point them at the freshly-built artifact so additive leaks can't ride a stale baseline | test | XS | — | **anytime** |
| ~~(archive 2026-07-07, blind judges) /simplify candidates for the immediate post-archive pass: renderer switch should index `WIRE_TO_AUTHOR_VERB[d.op]` instead of per-arm hardcoded keys (CONFIRMED by both judges); `Object.freeze` the map so "frozen" is literal; `DryRunEntry` example self-containment~~ **DONE 2026-07-07 `a96acc7` (/simplify pass)** — commons `@example` runnability intentionally NOT changed: REQ-DRE-04.1 mandates the `defineFactory` token and the runner isn't public until Stage 6, so a fully-runnable example is impossible today | refactor | XS | — | ~~immediate post-archive /simplify pass~~ **closed** |

## From engine handoff `l1-completion-gaps` (2026-07-06) — cross-repo contract notes

Engine-repo explore + owner decisions, transferred 2026-07-06. Engine references: engine
ADR-0027 (schematic runs in the SDK runtime), ADR-0028 (`create` carries already-resolved
`options`), ADR-0029 (templating renders `options` opaquely, fail-closed), and the upcoming
**PC-PROTO-01** (transport protocol — real `ir.emit`/`tree.read` + first-class error-mapping
REQ, mirrored ADR expected here like the ADR-0028 adoption). Real-wire integration unblocks
at PC-PROTO-01; engine sequencing before it: producer-fate ADR → PC-TM-01 templating →
`Engine.Execute` (S5).

> **SDK-side inputs now available (2026-07-15, `stdio-engine-client` REQ-LED-01)**:
> PC-PROTO-01's engine-side ratification now has concrete SDK-side artifacts to build against —
> `docs/engine-sdk-wire-design.md` rev 3 (historical decision trail, superseded sections marked)
> and the NEW normative `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` (methods, error shapes, pointer grammar,
> cap-constant naming, exit codes, bridge-contract section, wire-spec version 1). See the
> cross-repo tether row registered under `stdio-engine-client` below.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ownership transfer (owner 2026-07-06; semantics ratified 2026-07-06 at stage-4 explore)**: lifecycle reserved names are TWO namespaces — `pre-execute`/`post-execute` are SCHEMATIC-level (factory module lifecycle hooks; enforcement in Stage 4.3, `defineFactory` runner) and `add`/`remove` are COLLECTION-level (no collection concept exists yet — L2 territory). Stage 4.3 enforces the schematic pair; the collection pair stays reserved-by-documentation and its enforcement is REGISTERED for the L2/composition stage — it must not silently vanish. Note: `remove` collides with the shipped author verb only lexically — different namespace (collection entry vs SDK API) | feature | M | 4.3 (schematic pair); L2 (collection pair) | **4.3 + L2** |
| **Ownership transfer — RESOLVED (owner 2026-07-06)**: auto-prompt parity ratified as a schema-sufficiency CONTRACT, not a feature — the guard rail stands (the SDK renders no prompts; the Go CLI renders, consuming `schema.json`), and the SDK guarantees `schema.json` carries enough to derive prompts (labels, descriptions, defaults, types). Folded into `stage-4-typed-options` scope (4.2/4.3); council requires it encoded as a fitness function, not prose | other | — | In flight (stage-4-typed-options) | **4.2** |
| **Split from `stage-4-typed-options` (re-triage trigger, owner 2026-07-06)**: `stage-4b-testing-harness` — facade harness at `./testing` (`runFactoryForTest` wrapping the ONE normative `ContractFake` + `defineFactory`, no name re-exports), ADR-0009 amendment (third audience: author-testing), 4 companion guards (FIT-08 carve-out, dev-only bundle guard, FIT-04 dts baseline, FIT-09 exports entry), fail-closed parity invariant, AND `defineFactory` reachability (unreachable from any installed package today — `./core` unwired). ★D7 direction already owner-RATIFIED (facade); the change needs its own spec/design cycle. **OWNER COMMITMENT (steward foresight CQ1, 2026-07-07): COMMITTED-NEXT — stage-4's `aligned` verdict is conditional on 4b following; if 4b slips, stage-4's outcome crystallizes as outputs-without-outcome (steward reckoning will check)** | feature | L→M | Own /plan cycle IMMEDIATELY after stage-4 | **4.5 (own change, committed-next)** |
| Stage 2 error contract is **SDK-proposed, engine-unconfirmed until PC-PROTO-01**: the six `reason` values (`path-collision`, `path-not-found`, `unrepresentable-content`, `changes-too-large`, `unknown`, `outside-run`) and rejection-metadata field names (`verb`/`path`/`reason`/`appliedCount`) await the mapping REQ (engine `SystemError`/`DeveloperError`+`DeveloperFault` ↔ wire error shape ↔ SDK `origin`+`reason`). Stated assumptions for that ADR to confirm or correct: emit-rejection ⇒ `origin: "write-rejected"` (directive-level: `path-collision`/`path-not-found`; batch-level: `unrepresentable-content`/`changes-too-large`; unmapped ⇒ degrade to `unknown` per REQ-ERM-03); `outside-run` is SDK-local `authoring-rejected`, no engine mapping. `origin` itself is SDK-relative — nothing to unfreeze. **ADVANCE-NOTE 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client` REQ-LED-01)**: `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` § Error Shapes (WPS-08) now formalizes the WIRE-side half of this mapping (`error: {code: -32001, message, data: {emitRejectionCode, failedIndex?, appliedCount}}`, `emitRejectionCode` enum `collision`/`not-found`/`unrepresentable`/`cap`/`unknown`) — the SDK-proposed shapes are now a NORMATIVE, versioned wire contract both repos build against, not just an internal convention. Still engine-UNCONFIRMED until PC-PROTO-01 ratifies the engine-side `SystemError`/`DeveloperError` mapping onto it | other | — | PC-PROTO-01 ratification (non-blocking for Stage 2 build) | **2 (flag)** |

## From `stage-4-typed-options` (2026-07-11) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

Verify verdict `pass-with-followups`. Judgment-day APPROVED (2 blind judges, 0 crit/0 major).
Steward reckoning DELIVERED (owner-affirmed 2026-07-11). The coordinated Stage-2 AEC amendment
(reason enum six→eight + REQ-AEC-09 message rows) is **CLOSED IN-CHANGE** — applied to
`openspec/specs/authoring-error-contract/spec.md` (V2→V3) on 2026-07-10 — recorded here as
completed, NOT pending (verify-report F-03).

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AuthoringError` constructor's `message?: string` field is ungated across all eight `reason` values (compiles for any reason, weaker than the file's own exhaustive-switch idiom) — discriminated-union tightening (require `message` for `invalid-input`/`reserved-name`, forbid for the six legacy reasons) (verify-final F-01) | refactor | S | — | **next `authoring-error.ts` touch** |
| Bin `-h` short-flag alias is handled in code (`bin/pbuilder-codegen.ts:130`) but only `--help` has a test in `codegen-cli.test.ts` — add a `-h` case (verify-final F-02) | test-coverage | XS | — | **anytime** |
| The primary sufficiency gate in `generateSchema` lacks an independent mutation-guard test (the codegen-injection fix is caught by the `RECOGNIZED_KINDS` backstop, not by a test on the gate itself) — add a missing-label/enum-missing-choices refusal test (QA iter3, F-07) | test-coverage | XS | — | **anytime** |
| Numeric (non-string) `enum` `choices` (e.g. `[1,2]`) produce an unusable factory type — the generated type accepts `mode: 1`, but the run-boundary validator's `matchesType` requires `typeof value === "string"`, so both `mode:1` and `mode:"1"` are rejected; fail-safe (rejects, never accepts bad data) so LOW severity, not a security hole — `checkSufficiency` should hard-fail non-string enum choice elements (judgment-day Judge B, L-1) | edge-case | S | — | **stage-4b candidate** |
| Bin's `<dir>` relativization (`path.relative(process.cwd(), packageDir)`) leaks `../..`-style depth for out-of-tree packages — fall back to a basename-only display when relativization escapes the cwd (judgment-day Judge B, L-2; cosmetic) | refactor | XS | — | **anytime** |
| Parse/sufficiency ownership crack: a non-object property value can silently vanish from the in-memory `Schema` rather than being named as a sufficiency failure — mostly closed by the sufficiency hard-fail gate; confirm the residual is fully covered or add the missing scenario (architect, MINOR) | edge-case | S | — | **backlog (confirm residual)** |
| Glossary drift: `AuthoringError`'s `@example` names the factory input parameter `options`, contradicting this change's own `input`-contract framing (Stage-2 provenance, one-word fix) (tech-writer) | docs | XS | — | **anytime** |
| Bin `--help` output is thin — could name `schema.generated.ts` as the output and `schema.json` as the input explicitly (tech-writer, optional) | docs | XS | — | **optional** |
| Reserved-name structural scan (FIT-16 + runtime) recognizes only `.ts`/`.js` filenames — `.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.tsx` evade detection; spec-scoped to `{.ts,.js}` deliberately, so this is a documented known-limitation note, not a bug (QA nit) | docs | XS | — | **known-limitation note** |
| Planning artefacts (spec §"REQ-ID Stability", slices Coverage Check) label the REQ set "25 REQ-IDs"; the true distinct count is 23 (TFO×5, SCP×2, RBV×5, RLN×3, FPS×5, AEC×3) — an off-by-two arithmetic label; coverage itself is unaffected. Correct the label (verify-final F-06) | docs | XS | — | **doc hygiene, anytime** |

## From `stage-5-first-dialect` (2026-07-12) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

Verify verdict `pass-with-followups`. Judgment-day APPROVED (R1 clean — 0 critical, 0 real warnings). Steward reckoning DELIVERED (4 CQs affirmed, delivered). Six followups covering `stage-5b-dialect-breadth` integration + two Stage-6 deferred items.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| [stage-5b] extract the duplicated `deepEqual` (`src/conformance/index.ts` + `src/testing/contract-fake.ts`, both shipped) into a kit-internal shared module — has pkg-surface baseline implications, do alongside 5b | refactor | S | — | **5b** |

**Reaffirmed (already registered above, engine-handoff section, row "Split from `stage-4-typed-options`")**:
`stage-4b-testing-harness` stays **COMMITTED-NEXT** — steward reckoning CQ-3 condition: the
author-facing consumption path (`defineFactory` reachable from an installed package) + the
`./testing` harness are deferred from this change; if 4b slips indefinitely, stage-4's
differentiator stays theoretical for installed authors and CQ-1/CQ-2 (usability/significance)
should be revisited. No new row — this note ties the steward gate's condition back to the
existing pending-changes entry.

**DELIVERED 2026-07-12** — `stage-4b-testing-harness` archived; the COMMITTED-NEXT condition
above is satisfied (`defineFactory` + `runFactoryForTest` reachable from an installed package
via `./testing`, proven from a packed-tarball vantage; steward reckoning verdict `DELIVERED`).

## From `stage-4b-testing-harness` (2026-07-12) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

Verify verdict `pass-with-followups`. Judgment-day APPROVED (R1: 1 confirmed WARNING fixed in
`5ad8a73`; R2: both judges PASS). Steward reckoning `DELIVERED` — CQ2 (opted-in factory
support) answered YES and honored in-change (REQ-ATH-13); CQ1 and CQ3 below are carried as
owner-nod items, not gaps.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stage-6 `./core` production graduation: `defineFactory`'s production import home stays `./testing` until then (PM M4; steward CQ1 — an author's PRODUCTION `factory.ts` imports from a path literally named `./testing`; works today, 0.x-exempt, but is a naming-worth call for the owner to confirm, not a usability failure). **OWNER-RULED 2026-07-12 (stage-6 explore gate): stays `./testing` for stage-6; graduation re-registered as a mandatory re-evaluation inside the future public-package plan (pre-live-publish gate) — candidate home `./factory` per stage-6 explore blast-radius table**. **OWNER DIRECTION (2026-07-14, engram obs #2070, registered at `stage-6-release-shape` archive)**: the graduation shape itself is now narrowed — the author exports the BARE input-receiving function (not a `defineFactory`-wrapped value); `defineFactory` becomes INTERNAL to the runner/engine, never an author-facing export; `./commons` is the wrong home for it (a runner API, not author vocabulary). Supersedes the plain `./factory` candidate-home framing above; the future public-package plan re-evaluates against this narrower direction | other | M | Pre-live-publish | **public-package plan (own change)** |
| Throw-value-shape triangulation: a factory that `throw`s `undefined` is indistinguishable from success in `result.error`, and a `null` throw is a falsy-error-consumer hazard for authors who write `if (result.error)` (QA council) | edge-case | S | — | **backlog** |
| Exotic-path pass-through pin: path-traversal (`../`), NUL-byte, and unicode-normalization-edge paths are stored verbatim by the fake with no dedicated scenario pinning that behaviour (QA council) | test-coverage | XS | — | **backlog** |
| `deepEqual`'s `key in`/bracket-access pattern in `src/testing/contract-fake.ts` (batch-payload comparison) is the SAME class of prototype-chain leak the seed-lookup fix (`fbb3053`) closed for seed reads — inherited `Object.prototype` members could spuriously match on payload keys (fix-agent flag, unconfirmed on batch path) | edge-case | XS | — | **next `contract-fake.ts` touch** |
| FIT-17's dev-only bundle guard scans minified builds of the `src/` ENTRY FILES as a proxy for `dist/` (equivalence argued via tsc's 1:1 emission, §4.7) — have it scan the shipped `dist` entries directly as the source of truth instead (security council, low severity) | refactor | S | — | **backlog (hardening)** |
| Widen `REQ-ATH-11`'s in-memory instrumentation to cover `node:child_process` (SEC-m3, executor-optional at build time — never added) and dynamic `import()` parity, alongside the existing fs/net/Bun-I/O/fetch/env/argv surfaces (security council) | refactor | S | — | **backlog (hardening)** |
| Long-term form of ship-the-fake: `ContractFake` currently ships inside the production npm tarball behind six structural containment guards (ADR-0034) — is a permanent containment surface the right long-term shape, or should it become a separate `@pbuilder/testing` package (or BYO-fake docs)? Accepted 0.x expedient by owner ruling (ADR-0034); flagged for a deliberate long-term-form nod (steward CQ3, owner-nod pending, non-blocking) | other | L | — | **re-evaluate alongside `@pbuilder/sdk-kit` extraction (6.2)** |
| `RunResult.error`'s typed union `AuthoringError \| unknown` collapses to `unknown` at the type-checker (no narrowing value from the union today) — revisit the result-shape typing once `./testing` graduates past its semver-exempt window (arch note, verify-report) — **trigger RE-POINTED at the sdk-kit extraction / public-package plan (`stage-6-release-shape`, 2026-07-14, REQ-AOD-09.5), superseding the V1 "next 0.x result-shape iteration" trigger** | refactor | XS | — | **sdk-kit extraction / public-package plan** |

## From `bare-factory-migration` (2026-07-15) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

Verify verdict `pass-with-followups`. Judgment-day APPROVED. Steward reckoning DELIVERED (4 CQs affirmed). Architecture audit clean. Three ADRs promoted to project-level. Four non-blocking followups registered below.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-11 scratch-replica drift risk — the scratch-anchor replica in `test/fixtures/author-emulation/factory.ts` path skips `validateAtRunBoundary`, hardcodes the containment ceiling (`packageRoot === packageDir`), and lacks `checkReservedNames` scan-failure wrapper. Register a lockstep pin test OR a shared helper between `defineFactory`'s gate and the replica. Behavior preservation proven today (git-clean regen); the two paths can silently diverge in a future change. | refactor | S | — | **backlog** |
| Cosmetic comment-level tokens — 4 prose/comment mentions of `defineFactory` remain in `test/fake/harness-opted-in.test.ts` (:5, :17) and `test/scaffold/classify-transport.test.ts` (:5, :18), describing the migration itself. No spec scenario scans test comments; optional cleanup only. | docs | XS | — | **optional cleanup** |
| (FIT-29 namespace-import bypass) `import * as ctx from "..."` escape hatch documented or extended scan — both judgment-day judges noted theoretical: FIT-29's `specifiersResolvingInto` scan targets named imports only; namespace imports (`import * as`) would bypass the guard if an untrusted file re-exported a piped `defineFactory` binding. Verify-final ruled the risk theoretical (no production code currently namespace-imports); register as forward-looking hardening (no current violation). | security | S | — | **backlog (hardening)** |
| Spec REQ-ATH-01/17 `packageDir` type reconciliation — spec declares `packageDir?: string | URL`, runtime accepts only `string` (URL forwarding not implemented). Align the type or document the limitation (two implementations possible: explicit narrowing in JSDoc + @ts-expect-error, or genuine URL support at the validation boundary). | refactor | S | — | **doc-only or refactor, next harness touch** |

(Observation: TSD-01.4 seeded-read oracle tightening (co-occurrence check → structural match) and comments-only `defineFactory` tokens on REQ-FPS-05.2 `@example` are noted in verify-report but NOT registered as pending — the former is a refinement candidate when the second story-docs evolution occurs; the latter is correct-by-design (re-aimed internal example per REQ-FPS-05.2). Double-fault frozen/sealed-E1 branch in `context.ts:342-345` has no coverage — pre-existing, outside this change's scope.)

## From stage-6 planning grooming (2026-07-12) — owner-validated gaps

Owner use case validated in-session: schematics need to copy asset files from the schematic
package folder into the target tree (Angular Schematics' `apply(url('./files'))` mental model).
Two distinct debts surfaced:

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `copy` verb is emit-only end-to-end: SDK emits the directive correctly, fake + conformance vehicle simulate it faithfully, but the REAL engine drops it until the apply pass lands (ADR-0013 §copy; engine-side bytes-by-reference via `SourceFS` deferred to engine ADR-0028 §copy) — green tests ≠ files copied; needs the engine apply pass plus a real-wire assertion when PC-PROTO-01 unblocks integration. **ADVANCE-NOTE 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client`)**: the real-wire assertion this row awaits now has a normative wire text to assert against (`docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md`) — no change to this row's gating, PC-PROTO-01 is still the blocker | other | — | Engine ADR-0028 §copy apply pass | **cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |
| Schematic-package asset → target tree has NO mechanism: `copy` is tree→tree only (fake enforces `from` exists in the tree, FAKE-06); no `apply(url('./files'))` equivalent, no source-FS notion (ADR-0008 keeps the SDK disk-blind by design). Workaround today: author-side `readFileSync` + `create` — text only; binary assets cannot travel the text wire (ADR-0019). Candidate primitive: `SourceFS` bytes-by-reference at the engine seam. **OWNER-RULED 2026-07-12: out of stage-6 — own change** | feature | L | Engine seam contract (cross-repo) | **own change** |
| FIT-09/FIT-14 exports-guard extensibility refactor: split the frozen exact flat subpath list into a stable-core exact assert (`.`, `./commons`, `./conformance`, `./testing`) + an extensible dialect-set pattern assert, so a new dialect subpath is a one-row addition instead of a multi-file edit (package.json + FIT-09:77 + FIT-14:86-88 + baseline JSON). OWNER-RULED 2026-07-12: deferred — stage-5b adds no subpath (breadth within `./typescript`, exports byte-identical); first real consumer is a second dialect no plan contains yet | refactor | S | — | **second dialect (own trigger)** |
| **Public-package plan (own /plan cycle, owner-carved 2026-07-12 at stage-6 explore gate; EXTENDED 2026-07-12 at stage-6 steward foresight, CQ2)**: everything that makes `@pbuilder/sdk` a package OTHER PEOPLE consume — GitHub Packages dual-name config (`@project-builder-schematics/sdk` publish-time rewrite, consumer `.npmrc` auth-wart docs), live npm publish readiness + go-live interlocks (GitHub Environment reviewer gate, tag-triggered publish), `defineFactory` home re-evaluation (row above), and whatever real engine integration reveals is missing. **Now ALSO absorbs the npm placeholder publish** (deferred at steward foresight, CQ2 — the `@pbuilder` scope is already owner-controlled, so an inert stub buys no security today): the stub itself, ADR-0040's reasoning, the fit-22 inertness suite, the RUNBOOK, and the `0.0.1` semver-floor decision. Rationale: "mientras funcione el bun link… por el momento es overkill porque no está preparado para que nadie lo use." Stage-6 now keeps only: hardening of the EXISTING publish.yml surface (W3 guard, SHA pins) and the local consumption story — ZERO registry writes | feature | L | L1-readiness (post engine integration) | **own change (post-6)** |
| **GitHub Environment required-reviewers gate is a MANDATORY precondition of removing `--dry-run`** (go-live): `publish.yml`'s `--dry-run` pin (REQ-PPH-03) stays until a required-reviewers environment gate is configured on the publish job — makes security's conditional acceptance of the `--dry-run` pin durable rather than implicit. Deferred to the public-package plan (`stage-6-release-shape`, 2026-07-14, REQ-AOD-09.6) | security | XS | MANDATORY precondition of the first live publish | **public-package plan (own change)** |

## From author-emulation-e2e grooming (2026-07-13) — owner-stated program vision

Owner vision stated in-session: before engine construction resumes (post stage-6), the SDK's
trust must be stress-proven by AGGRESSIVE author-emulation e2e — write schematics the way a
real author would (reference shape: nestjs-schematics `crud-graphql-mongo` — templates, naming
transforms, module wiring, parametric options), drive them with scenario matrices from simplest
to most complex, and capture the emitted IR array at the `EngineClient` seam into a report that
serves three audiences: golden baselines in-repo, engine-handoff corpus, human inspection. The
first change (`author-emulation-e2e-scaffold`, in planning) covers the `scaffold` mutation
family only AND builds the shared IR-report infrastructure the rest reuse.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Author-emulation e2e per remaining mutation family: one change per author verb/family (`create`/`modify` incl. dialect chains, `move`/`rename`, `copy`, `remove`, `copyIn` standalone) following the scaffold change's pattern — realistic authored schematic + parametric scenario matrix (simple → complex) + IR capture into the shared report | test-coverage | M each | scaffold e2e change lands the shared report infra first | **own changes (post scaffold e2e)** |
| Combination author-emulation e2e: compositions ACROSS mutation families, simple → complex (full realistic generators combining scaffold + dialect modify + move/copy + params), same IR-report vehicle — the closest pre-engine approximation of production authoring | test-coverage | L | all per-mutation e2e changes done | **own change (capstone, pre-engine-return)** |

## From `schematic-local-files` (2026-07-13) — engine-side seam obligations, registered at S-005 ahead of archive

`schematic-local-files` delivers the SDK-side half of the row-208 primitive above (`scaffold`/
`copyIn`/`create({ templateFile })`, package-local reads by reference or by render request).
Design's own §Seam Contract section is explicit: **the engine, not the SDK, is the real
security control** for these three obligations — SDK-side containment (`src/scaffold/
containment.ts`) is DX/attribution only. All three are an **archive-gated deliverable**
(design §Migration/Rollout, product ruling Q23) — registering them here (siblings to row 208)
is a named acceptance criterion of this change's final slice, not prose intent. The owner
signs off on each at this change's archive gate.

**PC-PROTO-01** (referenced by all three rows below, gloss added at final-verify remediation
ITEM 10b for readers landing here directly): the engine's upcoming transport-protocol
ratification — real `ir.emit`/`tree.read` wire calls plus first-class error-mapping — that
unblocks real cross-repo integration; see the fuller definition above (engine handoff
`l1-completion-gaps` section).

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BRC-02 — engine ceiling re-derivation + TOCTOU closure**: the engine MUST re-derive its OWN containment ceiling for a by-reference (`copyIn`) source — open-then-fstat, never trusting the SDK-resolved `packageRoot`/`packageDir`. Anchor pin (ADR-0043 rev 2, seam clause S2): the emitted `copyIn.from` is relative to the RESOLUTION anchor (`packageDir`), not the containment ceiling (`packageRoot`) — the engine resolves `from` against its OWN re-derived `packageDir`, mirroring the SDK-side `package-root-containment` REQ-PRC-01 anchor distinction. **ADVANCE-NOTE 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client`)**: no change to this row's gating — noted alongside the wire spec's Bridge Contract/build-target pins for grouping | security | M | Blocking engine apply-pass for `copyIn`/by-reference `scaffold` entries | **engine repo, cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |
| **BRC-08 — non-canonical path-form rejection + single-pass literal-token render**: the engine MUST reject non-canonical path forms (UNC/device/reserved-DOS/drive-relative) for BOTH the by-reference source and the rendered destination, and MUST render a `create` directive's `pathTemplate` single-pass (substituted token values are literal segments, never re-scanned as further template syntax). Canonical-form hardening is explicitly OUT of SDK scope — `package-root-containment` REQ-PRC-04/Q24 case-folds on case-insensitive platforms SDK-side only; this row is the engine-side complement. **ADVANCE-NOTE 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client`)**: the frame contract (length-prefix, cap) this row's blast radius sits behind is now pinned in `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` — no change to this row's gating | security | M | Blocking engine apply-pass for `copyIn`/`scaffold`/`create({templateFile})` | **engine repo, cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |
| **PRC-06 — post-render destination containment**: the engine MUST enforce destination containment POST-RENDER — after token substitution, the final on-disk destination path must be re-validated against the target workspace boundary. SDK-side `validateDestinationLexical` (`package-root-containment` REQ-PRC-09) is lexical-only, pre-render, and cannot see rendered token values — it is DX/attribution only, never the security control for a rendered destination. **ADVANCE-NOTE 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client`)**: unaffected by the wire contract directly; noted alongside BRC-02/BRC-08 for grouping — no change to this row's gating | security | M | Blocking engine apply-pass for `scaffold`/`create` | **engine repo, cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |

> **Archive sign-off (2026-07-13)**: owner RE-AFFIRMED at archive that the engine copy-apply
> pass (PC-PROTO-01-tied) is **committed-next SCHEDULED** — not merely registered debt. These
> three rows are the formal tether for that commitment; `schematic-local-files` archives on the
> strength of this scheduling affirmation (steward reckoning conscience question 1). If the
> engine-side pass does not land, the by-reference (binary) half of this change risks
> crystallizing as outputs-without-outcome — re-open this note if the schedule slips.

| Judge F (judgment-day iter 3) non-blocking observation: the archived `schematic-local-files` Executor-Context §5 note ("a rename smuggling `../` … is caught") is IMPRECISE — a `rename` value whose `..` segments are fully absorbed by a multi-segment `to` actually lands the file at the workspace root, not literally "caught" as escaping. This is WITHIN contract (REQ-FSC-02 permits remap, REQ-PRC-09's workspace boundary holds, the engine post-render check is the real control) — not a code defect, only an imprecise internal note. The note lives in the SEALED archive folder (`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-13-schematic-local-files/slices.md` §Executor Context) — not edited (archived folders are never modified after the move); registered here instead so a future reader of that note isn't misled | docs | XS | — | — |

## From `ts-dialect-backend-ops` planning (2026-07-14) — dialect op-catalog ledger (owner-ratified re-cut)

Council review (architect + PM, independent convergence) found the original Tier-1 cut (11 ops
spanning 3 distinct mechanisms, ~6 implied ADRs, 11 public signatures frozen at once) to be an
XL disguised as an L. Owner re-cut the full op catalog into complexity-ordered GROUPS, each
introducing exactly ONE new difficulty; each group below is its own future change. **Group 1
(import/export variants) is the current change `ts-dialect-backend-ops`** and is therefore not
a row here. Complexity was ranked on two axes: AST difficulty AND contract difficulty
(addressing model, collision namespace, idempotency identity, frozen-kit impact) — note the
inversion on query ops: trivial AST, widest contract blast radius.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Group 1 — import/export variants**: `addDefaultImport`, `addNamespaceImport`, `addTypeImport`, `addSideEffectImport`, `addReExport`, `addExportAll`, `removeExport`. New difficulty: NONE — extends the shipped `addImport`/`removeImport` mechanism verbatim (module-specifier addressing, name+module idempotency identity, ratified merge precedent), which is why it is first. **Planning PAUSED 2026-07-14 by owner after explore** — triage + explore artefacts are complete and persisted (`openspec/changes/ts-dialect-backend-ops/`, engram topics `sdd/ts-dialect-backend-ops/{triage,explore}`); four owner decisions are open and block propose: (a) fold in row (22) identifier validation — security-engineer marks halt-worthy, injection CONFIRMED not theoretical (see the security row below); (b) `addTypeImport` emitted form — separate `import type { X }` vs inline `{ type X }` modifier (the only Group-1 decision that reaches the emitted bytes, hence the hardest to reverse); (c) `removeExport` scope + the add/remove asymmetry (4 new add-import forms ship with no remove counterparts); (d) whether `addExportAll` covers `export * as ns` | feature | L | Owner decisions (a)-(d) above | **paused mid-plan — resume at propose** |
| **CONFIRMED injection surface (was row (22), re-classified from theoretical)** — empirically probed against the pinned `ts-morph@28.0.0` during Group-1 explore: `name`-position arguments are spliced into emitted source RAW (unescaped). `addImport('x } from "evil"; import { y', 'b')` emits a syntactically-valid extra import from an attacker-chosen module; `print()` performs no re-validation, so nothing gates it. `from`-position args ARE string-literal-escaped by ts-morph (breakout blocked there). The mainstream author path parameterises `name` from consumer-supplied schema `options`, and `src/dialects/typescript/**` is registered `security (code execution): high` — so this is a live path, not an exotic one. Fix: one shared TS-identifier validator (`^[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*$`, both sides of any `as` alias) rejecting via branded `dialectError` BEFORE any AST mutation, mirroring the shared-`assertNoCollision` pattern. Group 1 is uniquely fully-validatable (every arg is an identifier or specifier — no free-form-code arg like `addFunction(source)`). **Applies to the ALREADY-SHIPPED ops too, not only new ones** — this is not gated on Group 1 landing | security | M | — | **fold into Group 1, or its own change if Group 1 stays paused** |
| **Latent collision-predicate gap (found at Group-1 explore, applies to SHIPPED code)** — `assertNoCollision` (`src/dialects/typescript/ops.ts`) scans import bindings via `getNamedImports()` only; it never inspects `getDefaultImport()`/`getNamespaceImport()`. Harmless today because no shipped op creates those bindings — but it is the same class of gap judgment-day round 1 already caught twice (missing enum/namespace). The moment `addDefaultImport`/`addNamespaceImport` exist, `addFunction("Foo")` will fail to detect an existing `import Foo from "m"` and emit TS2451-invalid code. **Precondition of Group 1**, not an optional hardening | bugfix | S | Blocks `addDefaultImport`/`addNamespaceImport` | **with Group 1** |
| **Latent type-contamination bug in shipped `addImport` (found at Group-1 explore)** — `addImport` merges into the FIRST declaration matching the module specifier (`getImportDeclaration`, singular). If that first declaration is type-only (`import type { A } from "m"`), ts-morph's `addNamedImport("B")` grafts the VALUE import B into the type-only clause → `import type { A, B }`, silently making B type-only. Unreachable today (no op creates type-only declarations); Group 1's `addTypeImport` makes it reachable. Also note the shipped add/remove asymmetry over multi-declaration modules: `addImport` is first-match, `removeImport` iterates ALL matching declarations (judgment-day Issue 2 fix) — every new add-op must state which posture it takes or implementers will copy first-match and reintroduce the bug | bugfix | S | Reachable once `addTypeImport` exists | **with Group 1** |
| **Test-suite weakness (found at Group-1 explore)** — the shipped "idempotency" test (REQ-TSD-09.6, `ops-declarations.test.ts`) runs the op on a fresh empty file twice and compares: that proves DETERMINISM, not idempotency. It survives a mutation that deletes the `alreadyPresent` guard entirely, because it never seeds the post-state. True idempotency = seed the file with the op's own output, apply, assert ZERO emitted directives (the assertion shape `ops-removeImport.test.ts` already uses for absent-binding no-ops). Backfill for `addImport`, and do not let any new op copy the fresh-file-twice shape | test-coverage | S | — | **with Group 1 (establishes the pattern)** |
| **Group 2 — type-level top-level declarations**: `addInterface`, `addTypeAlias`, `addEnum`. New difficulty: TYPE-namespace collision predicate (purely additive ADR-0039 amendment — the value-namespace rule stays frozen); `enum` occupies BOTH namespaces (value + type), the finest case | feature | M | After Group 1 lands (reuses its test/idempotency patterns) | **own change** |
| **Group 3 — named-container member surgery**: `addEnumMember`, `addInterfaceProperty`, `addUnionMember`, `addClassProperty`, `addClassMethod`, `addImplements`, `addDecorator`, `addConstructorParam`, `removeDeclaration`. New difficulty: mutating INSIDE containers located by top-level name (2-hop addressing, no new locator abstraction); `addConstructorParam` must create a missing constructor; `addUnionMember` has a structural precondition (alias must be a union); `removeDeclaration` is reference-blind by design (no-LS commitment) | feature | L | Group 2 (type-namespace predicate for interface/enum member semantics) | **own change** |
| **Group 4 — nested expression surgery**: `addArrayElement`, `addObjectProperty`, `setObjectProperty`, `addCallArgument`, `addStatementToFunction`. New difficulty: the PUBLIC locator/addressing abstraction — the hardest-to-reverse API decision in the catalog (design the MINIMUM addressing these ops need; a selector/query DSL is explicitly out of scope); structural idempotency identity (first non-name-keyed identity); position semantics (`addStatementToFunction`); key-conflict family (`addObjectProperty` reject/overwrite/no-op must be placed in the ADR-0039 merge-vs-reject family explicitly) | feature | L | Locator ADR at its own design phase | **own change** |
| **Group 5 — query/confirm ops**: `hasImport`, `hasDeclaration`, `hasExport`, `hasMember`. Trivial AST, widest contract blast radius: a boolean-returning op breaks the frozen kit's void/chainable `Op` contract (`src/core/define-dialect.ts`, consumed by conformance + third-party dialects) and collides with async read-through (`#ensureLive`, ADR-0037). Needs a return-channel ADR ratified BEFORE any implementation; do not smuggle as "just two more ops" | feature | L | Frozen-kit return-channel ADR (own decision) | **own change** |
| **Group 6 — composed Layer-2 ops**: `ensureImport`, `registerInArray`, `addInjectedDependency`, `addEndpoint`. Zero own AST — pure composition of Groups 1-5 atomic ops (a Layer-2 op never touches ts-morph directly); query-dependent compositions additionally gated on Group 5's return channel | feature | M | Groups 1-4 stable; Group 5 for query-dependent compositions | **own change (after atomic layer stabilizes)** |
| Framework-specific helpers (Nest/Express/TypeORM) — ruled OUT of the dialect entirely; authors compose them from primitives in userland | — | — | — | **not now (explicit non-goal)** |

## From engine↔SDK wire design (2026-07-14) — DELIVERED by `stdio-engine-client` (2026-07-15)

> **Stale preamble note (2026-07-15, REQ-LED-01)**: the paragraph below describes the
> PRE-implementation design record as it stood 2026-07-14 ("stdio JSON-RPC single-initiator")

Design record: `docs/engine-sdk-wire-design.md` (stdio JSON-RPC single-initiator; runner contract
per the bare-factory owner direction, obs #2070; `collection.json` without a `schema` field —
adjacency convention per ADR-0031 owns the schema location). Cross-repo contract with the Go
CLI/engine; the wire spec is a deliverable of the change, not a prerequisite from the engine side.

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`StdioEngineClient` — first real `EngineClient` implementation (JSON-RPC over stdio, NDJSON framing, `session.init` version handshake, engine rejections mapped to ADR-0022 `EmitRejection`). Ships together with: the `pbuilder-runner` bin (argv contract `--factory <url>#<export>` / `--input` / `--input-file`; resolved PROJECT-LOCAL per the single-SDK-instance pin — engine must never bundle its own SDK copy, or the module-level ALS splits and every verb throws `outside-run`; wraps the author's BARE factory export with the runner-internal `defineFactory`, supplying `packageDir = dirname(factory)` via the adjacency convention), a normative wire spec (versioned with the handshake), and a scripted fake-engine conformance harness (spawned process speaking NDJSON over real stdio — no Go required to verify). Consumes the `defineFactory` graduation direction (obs #2070, stage-4b row above)~~ **CLOSED — superseded by `stdio-engine-client`** (2026-07-15, REQ-LED-01.2): NDJSON framing → length-prefix framing (`docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` § Frame Grammar, WPS-01); `session.init` version handshake → versioned `ready` (§ Ready Handshake, WPS-02); the row's undefined bootstrap mechanism → the argv/bridge composition root (`src/transport/runner.ts` + `bootstrap-bridge.ts`, WPS-09/BRB-01). See `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` (normative) + `docs/engine-sdk-wire-design.md` rev 3 (historical record) | feature | L | Before any engine-backed release | **DELIVERED — SDK half shipped by `stdio-engine-client`; engine PC-PROTO-01 is the build target, see cross-repo tether row below** |
| Factory scaffold (`pbuilder-codegen` extension or `init-schematic`) emitting a typed bare `factory.ts` (`(input: Input) => void`) plus adjacent `schema.json` — DX counterpart of the bare-export contract (authors never write `defineFactory` boilerplate; the typed signature is the compile-time anchor the wrapper's generic used to provide). **RE-HOMED 2026-07-15 (owner ruling, engram obs #2161, `stdio-engine-client` S-005.4)**: "the runner change" (`StdioEngineClient`) has now shipped without this row — re-homed to the public-package plan, its own scheduling unit | feature | S | — | **public-package plan** |
| ~~Author-surface migration to the bare-factory shape (blast radius measured 2026-07-14): rewrite the 5 author-facing docs showing the wrap (`README.md` ×7, `docs/quickstart.md` ×4, `docs/dry-run.md` ×3, `docs/authoring-verbs.md`, `docs/authoring-errors.md`) + their fenced-snippet compile tests; change `runFactoryForTest` to accept the bare `(input) => void` shape, wrapping internally via the SAME code path the runner uses (parity-by-identity, FIT-18 philosophy); drop `defineFactory` from public subpath exports + exports-guard baselines (FIT-09/FIT-14, `./testing` facade re-export). Transition guard in the runner: brand-detect an already-wrapped export and reject with an educational error (double-wrap = cryptic destructuring TypeError otherwise); guard retires once the export is gone. NOT migration work: the ~67 internal test files calling `defineFactory` directly — it remains internal API~~ **RETIRED 2026-07-15 (`stdio-engine-client` S-005.4, verified against the shipped archive)** — DELIVERED by `archive/2026-07-15-bare-factory-migration`: the 5 author-facing docs no longer show the wrap (verified: zero `defineFactory` references in `README.md`/`docs/{quickstart,dry-run,authoring-verbs,authoring-errors}.md`); `runFactoryForTest` takes an options bag (`packageDir?`) and delegates to `defineFactory` internally (ADR-0051/ADR-0052); `defineFactory` graduated out of `./testing`'s public exports to core-internal, structurally enforced by FIT-08/FIT-29 (ADR-0050); the double-wrap brand-marker transition guard exists (`src/core/context.ts`, reused by THIS change's own RUN-06/ADR-04) | docs | M | — | **closed** |

## From `author-write-surface` triage re-cut (2026-07-14) — deferred by owner decision after blind council review

The original scope bundled four changes; PM + architect independently converged on cutting to
the honest write-verb rename core (that change proceeds: `openspec/changes/author-write-surface/`).
The three deferred pieces map to EXISTING ledger homes — this section is traceability, not new rows:

| Deferred piece | Existing home | Extra condition registered here |
|---|---|---|
| Public dialect-kit subpath (`defineDialect`/`defineOpPack`/`withOps`), ADR-0009 revisit | Public-package plan / `@pbuilder/sdk-kit` extraction rows | Must state the subpath's semver posture, rework FIT-08 (no-kit-bleed) as allowlist-inversion, and confirm the `Session.emit`/`EngineClient` single-chokepoint survives exposure (architect triage note, 2026-07-14) |
| `hasImport` + query helpers | Group 5 (boolean-returning ops) | Unchanged gate: return-channel ADR ratified BEFORE implementation; sequenced after Groups 1-4 |
| Standalone op-function exports from `./typescript` (composition inside `modify(fn)` callbacks) | Follows the row-320 CONFIRMED identifier-injection validator | Do NOT widen the confirmed-vulnerable surface before the shared TS-identifier validator lands; note `modify(fn)` already gives authors full ts-morph natively, so urgency is low |

## From `author-write-surface` (2026-07-14) — accepted as non-blocking at archive

Verify verdict `pass-with-followups` (2 followups fixed at close: FIT-04 content assertion + stale comment). Judgment-day APPROVED (1 suggestion applied). Steward reckoning DELIVERED (3 conscience questions owner-ratified, outcome aligned).

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flaky `test/e2e/installed-consumer.e2e.test.ts` tarball leg — ~25% failure rate on CI; pre-existing issue, masks archive signals; root cause not in this change (manifest/corpus/build-pipe stability) | test-infra | M | — | **next build-infra / e2e harness pass** |
| `replaceContent("")` empty-content boundary untested — completeness gap in REQ-MC-01/MC-03 (empty string mutation coverage); pre-existing compliance gap | test-coverage | S | — | **test-pyramid-hardening pass** |
| `defineDialect` own-ops bypass the reserved-name guard that `withOps` enforces — latent gap in REQ-DG-02 collision namespace (own-provided ops can shadow reserved names without hitting the assertion, in-trust model); add symmetric guard or document caveat before dialect publishing | refactor | M | — | **before public `defineDialect` / op-pack publishing** |
| `openspec/sensitive-areas.md` spelling refresh: update `.raw()` escape-hatch documentation to `.modify()` (one-line) — consistency patch after honest-verb rename lands | docs | XS | — | **first sensitive-areas refresh pass** |

| Importable `modify(handle, fn)` form from `./typescript` + the run-identity guard subsystem (cross-run loud reject via controller `#origin` stamp). Steward foresight (obs #2127) flagged it as ergonomics-not-honesty with the largest net-new complexity in the rename; owner deferred (obs #2128). PRIOR ART preserved: REQ-TSD-12 V3 spec text (engram obs #2119 history) + design `#origin`/`#bindOrigin` mechanism (design.md / obs #2126) — a future change starts from ratified spec+design, not zero | feature | S-M | Lands AFTER `author-write-surface` merges (needs the renamed `.modify(fn)` surface) | **own change, post-rename** |

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows/macOS production pins: this change's fake-engine harness and e2e suite are proven on this repo's Linux dev/CI image only — `single-instance-probe.ts`'s realpath comparison, `captureFd1FrameWriter`'s `process.stdout` stub replacement, and the spawned-process harness (`bun run <bin>` + real stdio pipes) have no cross-platform CI run yet | edge-case | S | Before any Windows/macOS production release | **deferred — public-package plan** |
| **Cross-repo tether**: engine `PC-PROTO-01` MUST build against `docs/engine-sdk-wire-design.md` rev 3 + `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` wire-spec version 1 — NOT rev 2. Conformance = the Go side passes the same wire vectors this repo's fake-engine harness (`test/fake/harness.test.ts` + `test/fake/*.e2e.test.ts`) already encodes; engine `MaxMessageBytes` MUST equal SDK `BATCH_CAP_BYTES` (4 MiB / 4194304) per the wire-spec's Frame-Cap Constant clause (WPS-06/FEH-06) | feature | — | PC-PROTO-01 (engine repo) | **engine repo, cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |
| ~~Pre-existing `session.ts` behavior (verify-final council, architect): a `TransportFault` surfacing during `Session.flush()`'s emit leg is degraded by the `toAuthoringError` catch-all to exit code 2 (emit-rejection) instead of 3 (transport fault) — documented in `openspec/changes/stdio-engine-client/apply-progress.md:256-263`. Future `session.ts` changes touching the emit fault path should reclassify wire faults before the catch-all rather than rediscovering this from scratch~~ **CLOSED — FIXED 2026-07-16** (judgment-day round 1, finding F1): `Session.flush` now recognizes a `TransportFault` by stable `name` identity BEFORE calling `toAuthoringError` and re-throws it untranslated (exit 3 preserved) — `src/core/session.ts`, commit `867c342`. Proven by `test/fake/exit-matrix.e2e.test.ts`'s ir.emit-pending legs. Main-spec sync: `emit-rejection-metadata` REQ-ERM-03 gained the transport-class carve-out (V3 amendment, `stdio-engine-client` archive) | edge-case | S | — | **closed** |
| Bridge sequential-rerun residual (judgment-day R2): a timed-out call's parked stdin read (`StdioEngineClient` `#danglingRead`) can survive run end on the bridge path and consume bytes of a SUBSEQUENT session if the engine reuses the same stdin iterable across sequential `enterBridge` runs in one process — paired with `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md`'s once-per-run `enterBridge` claim (Bridge Contract section: re-entry tolerated, residual named); engine team to ratify the sequential-rerun lifecycle at PC-PROTO-01 | edge-case | S | PC-PROTO-01 (engine repo) | **engine repo, cross-repo flag (with PC-PROTO-01)** |

## From `stdio-engine-client` archive (2026-07-16) — verify-final, council, and judgment-day followups

| Description | Type | Size | Gating? | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-1** Cold-start suite flake (pre-existing, outside this change's diff): `test/bin/codegen-static-scan.test.ts`'s unconditional `beforeAll` self-build (`bun run build` → `rm -rf dist`) intermittently errors on the first `bun test` run after a fresh install (7 tests / 8 expect() short, 1 error, 0 fail, exit 0; never reproduced warm). Fix: route through `test/support/shared-build.ts::ensureTscBuild()` (memoized) like fit-04/fit-17, or add a cold-start CI retry | test-infra | S | — | **next test-infra pass** |
| **F-2** SEC-07 probe real-resolver happy path is only exercised via the self-reference fallback branch (dead in real deployments) — primary-path MATCH is proven with an injected resolver only. Fix candidates: a `package.json` self-reference `exports` condition, or a split-package fixture whose two roots are realpath-identical | test-coverage | S | — | **next `single-instance-probe.ts` touch** |
| **F-3** `packageRootFor` (`src/transport/single-instance-probe.ts:45`) duplicates `findProjectRoot` (`bin/pbuilder-codegen.ts:79`) — unguarded twin package-root walks; extract a shared helper (touches code outside this change's scope) | refactor | S | — | **next touch of either file** |
| **F-4** `src/transport/runner.ts` uncovered arms (81.71% lines, 232-254): drive the four export-resolution message arms (and defensive argv/stat/JSON branches) through `runRunner` at runtime — classification itself is already fully proven in `factory-pointer.unit.test.ts` | test-coverage | S | — | **next `runner.ts` touch** |
| **F-5** `dist/bin` build wiring for `pbuilder-runner` deferred to the public-package plan (ADR-0058 documented deviation — the bin currently produces no `dist/` output; `package.json#bin` entry also deferred) | refactor | S | Before any public release exposing the runner bin | **public-package plan** |
| Council (security): `error-text.ts`'s 200-char token-cap bounding applies to `discard()`'s note text and the factory-pointer echo, but the two truncation call sites aren't proven identical byte-for-byte against a shared fixture — theoretical drift risk if one site's cap constant is edited without the other | test-coverage | XS | — | **next `error-text.ts` touch** |
| Council (security): `reconstructEmitRejection`'s `appliedCount` carry-through (SEC-04.2) is proven for the forcing-degrade cases but not cross-checked against every `EmitRejectionCode` member as new codes are added — register a table-driven exhaustiveness test | test-coverage | XS | — | **next `EmitRejectionCode` addition** |
| Council (QA): no e2e leg drives a runner EOF (stdin closed pre-greeting or mid-run) all the way to its exit-code classification — unit-level coverage exists (`exit-codes.unit.test.ts`) but the spawned-process leg is missing | test-coverage | S | — | **next fake-engine-harness e2e pass** |
| Council (architect): `src/transport/errors.ts` extraction — `TransportFault`, `OverlappingRunError`, `IntentRejectedError`, `BridgeVersionMismatchError` currently live inline in their owning modules; a dedicated errors module would centralize the transport error taxonomy as the cluster grows | refactor | S | — | **next transport error added** |
| Council (architect): `fit-31-single-owner-framing.test.ts` now bundles the framing-ownership scan AND the WPS-11 doc-reconciliation scan AND the LED-01 ledger scan — cohesion split recommended at the next touch rather than growing a 4th concern into it | refactor | XS | — | **next `fit-31` touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical, unconfirmed): `Session.read()`'s `tree.read` result-shape guard trusts the host's `{content}` envelope structurally but doesn't defend against a host that returns an extra unexpected field colliding with a future SDK-side field name | edge-case | XS | — | **PC-PROTO-01 (engine repo)** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): the greeting-phase read has no explicit timeout bound distinct from the per-call `SEC-05` timeout — a host that never sends `ready` hangs the runner indefinitely at handshake | edge-case | S | — | **next handshake-path touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): a clean EOF arriving BEFORE the greeting (host process exits immediately) is not given its own named exit-code arm distinct from a mid-run EOF — worth a dedicated taxonomy entry | edge-case | XS | — | **next `exit-codes.ts` touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): the desync-continuation posture (a conformant host keeps serving after a malformed frame, per SEC-08.1's recovery) has no doc-level note explaining WHY continuation is safe here vs. other fault classes that stay fatal | docs | XS | — | **next `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): `FrameReader`'s buffering reassembly is O(n²) over payload bytes in the worst case (repeated `Buffer.concat` on a heavily-chunked stream) — no production impact observed (no hot path, design §4.9), registered as a forward-looking perf note only | perf | XS | — | **only if profiling shows it matters** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): WPS-11.2's header-stamp scenario doesn't pin the wire-spec doc's header to name the SPECIFIC engine build target string format, only that a target is named — a future doc edit could rename the field without failing the scan | docs | XS | — | **next `docs/engine-sdk-wire-spec.md` header touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): the superseded-decisions section's "host-initiated" phrasing (rev-3 doc) could read as ambiguous between "the host initiates the TCP/process" vs. "the host initiates each wire exchange" to a reader unfamiliar with the rev-2→rev-3 history | docs | XS | — | **next wire-design.md historical-section touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): the stdout stub (`as unknown as typeof process.stdout` in `framing.ts`) doesn't implement the full `Writable`/stream surface — any future author code calling an unstubbed stream method (e.g. `.cork()`) would hit `undefined is not a function` instead of a clean capture | edge-case | XS | — | **next `framing.ts` stub-surface touch** |
| Judgment-day (theoretical): RUN-04's oversize-input-file gate is a `statSync` size check before read — a TOCTOU window exists between stat and read if the file grows between the two calls; acceptable today because the input file is author-local and single-reader, revisit if that assumption (A1) changes | security | XS | — | **only if the input-file trust assumption changes** |
| Architecture audit: `test/fitness/dts-baseline` carries a stale `defineFactory` JSDoc comment predating `bare-factory-migration`'s core-internal graduation (ADR-0050) — pre-existing, carried, not introduced by this change | docs | XS | — | **next dts-baseline regen** |
| Architecture audit: `openspec/decisions/` has a PRE-EXISTING numbering collision — TWO files are both numbered `0050` (`0050-definefactory-core-internal-removal.md` and `0050-handle-unfreeze-honest-write-verb-rename.md`), predating this archive. NOT fixed here (out of this change's scope; renumbering a shipped ADR file changes its filename in history) — flag for a dedicated ADR-renumbering pass | docs | XS | — | **dedicated ADR-renumber pass** |
| Process: run `/sdd-init force=true` to raise the IPC sensitive-area confidence from `low` now that a real `EngineClient` implementation exists (design §4.8 migration-plan item) | process | XS | — | **next SDD command in this project** |
| **`.jsx` extension support for the React dialect** (deferred from `react-dialect` v1; owner-requested register 2026-07-16, mid-plan) — v1 gates `find()` to `.tsx` ONLY; plain-JS `.jsx` files stay unopenable by any dialect. The `.tsx` fidelity evidence does NOT transfer: `.jsx` (ScriptKind.Jsx, JS-flavored parse) is an unspiked print-fidelity surface — needs its own adversarial corpus + byte-exact spike mirroring the `.tsx` 20-sample discipline before admission. The v1 wrong-extension error already names this deferral (REQ-RXD-02). At archive of `react-dialect`, fold into the React op-catalog group plan or re-affirm standalone — never orphan (the spec Notes-for-sdd-archive cross-reference this row) | feature | M | `.jsx` fidelity spike (own corpus) | **React op-catalog follow-up plan** |
