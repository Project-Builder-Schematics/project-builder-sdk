# Specs: stage-4-typed-options

**Spec version**: V4
**Status**: signed (owner, 2026-07-07)
**Change**: `stage-4-typed-options`
**Triage**: L

**V3 → V4 delta (micro-unfreeze, owner-authorized 2026-07-07)**: the "Interim Behaviour"
clause is rewritten from an interim `AuthoringError` to a plain-`Error` interim (Option A —
resolves plan-verify iteration-2 gaps 3/4). The prior interim
`AuthoringError{origin:"authoring-rejected"}` was UNCONSTRUCTIBLE against Stage-2's
origin-derived-from-`reason` design (ADR-0021: `origin` derives from a CLOSED `reason` enum,
and no interim `reason` truthfully maps until the two new members land). No REQ-ID
added/removed/renamed; scenario text is touched ONLY where it asserted the interim
`AuthoringError` shape (REQ-RBV-01/02 status lines and REQ-RLN-02.1 in the domain specs). The
V3 sign-off and all other content carry forward unchanged.

**V2 → V3 delta (micro-amendment, owner-authorized unfreeze 2026-07-07)**: ONE scenario
added — REQ-FPS-05.4 (README qualifying-line for incremental shipping, reverted in
stage-4b). No other change: no REQ-ID added/removed/renamed, no scenario text edited, all
25 REQ-IDs and their existing scenarios stable. Closes plan-verify iteration-1 gap 1 (the
README qualifying-line was an `in_scope` item with a slice task, S-005, but no REQ
coverage). The V2 sign-off below and all its content carry forward unchanged.

V2 — blind spec-council feedback (business-analyst, qa-engineer, tech-writer,
security-engineer) applied: 6 blockers, 12 majors, 8 minors folded in (26 findings total).
All 20 V1 REQ-IDs preserved; 5 NEW REQ-IDs added (REQ-TFO-05, REQ-RBV-04, REQ-RBV-05,
REQ-FPS-05, REQ-AEC-09). Same 6 domains as V1; no domain added or removed.

## Upstream Ingest / Sync

`spec_source: internal` — Step 5b (upstream ingest) and Step 10b (upstream sync) do not
apply. This spec is authored directly from the proposal.

## Glossary (TW-F8)

- **schematic** == **factory-module**: the package pair (`factory.ts` + adjacent
  `schema.json`) an author ships; the two terms are used interchangeably throughout these
  specs.
- **input**: the schema-derived RUNTIME value resolved and passed into a factory
  (`defineFactory<O>`'s `o`). Distinct from **options**, which stays reserved for the
  `create<S>` template-interpolation plane (an unrelated, already-shipped capability) —
  never use "options" for `defineFactory`'s input in these specs or in generated errors.
- **fitness function**: this SDK's house term for a build/CI-time structural or contract
  check (the `FIT-NN` test files) — not a general "code quality" metric.

## Interim Behaviour (pre-Stage-2-amendment) — consolidated (BA-1/QA-M1; rewritten V4, Option A)

Everything REASON-INDEPENDENT is buildable and testable NOW; the whole error-CLASS wiring
(`AuthoringError` construction, its `origin`, its `reason`) is what the coordinated Stage-2
amendment (REQ-AEC-07/08/09, this change's `authoring-error-contract` domain) unlocks. Stage-2's
`AuthoringError` DERIVES `origin` from a CLOSED `reason` enum (ADR-0021), and no interim `reason`
truthfully maps to an "authoring-rejected" input/name rejection until the two new enum members
land — so an interim `AuthoringError{origin:"authoring-rejected"}` is UNCONSTRUCTIBLE, and this
change does NOT attempt to construct one before S-006.

INTERIM (the S-000..S-005 `/build` deliverable), an author who supplies a schema-violating input
or declares a reserved lifecycle name experiences: the run is REJECTED (never silently accepted or
partially applied — all-or-nothing holds); the rejection happens at the correct SITE (run-boundary
pre-`als.run` for RBV, module-validation for RLN — never the emit seam; nothing is staged and the
engine client's `emit` is never invoked); the thrown value is a **plain `Error`** (NOT an
`AuthoringError`); its `.message` is the EXACT pinned literal for that rejection class (the
REQ-AEC-09 template rows — the SINGLE source of truth for the wording) and NEVER echoes a raw input
value (the canary no-echo scan, REQ-RBV-04, covers these plain-`Error` surfaces). Fail-closed
semantics (present-but-unreadable/unparseable schema → reject, REQ-RBV-05) hold interim on the
plain-`Error` throw.

The three things an author cannot yet do — ALL deferred to S-006 (post `stage-2-error-attribution`
archive + the coordinated `sdd-spec` amendment): assert `instanceof AuthoringError`, inspect
`origin`, or `switch` on a `reason` value. Until S-006 lands, tests assert everything above EXCEPT
those three, and do NOT assert the interim throw is an `AuthoringError`. S-006 UPGRADES every
interim plain-`Error` throw to the final `AuthoringError` shape and flips these assertions on.

Interim RBV-vs-RLN distinguishability (REQ-RLN-02.1) is carried by the two DISTINCT pinned message
literals (`invalid input: …` vs. `reserved lifecycle name: …`); reason/origin-based
distinguishability is S-006. This applies uniformly to REQ-RBV-01/02 and REQ-RLN-02. REQ-RBV-04,
REQ-RBV-05, and REQ-RLN-01 (excluding its design-gated Scenario .1) carry NO Stage-2 dependency —
and with the plain-`Error` interim, NEITHER DO S-000..S-005: the ONLY remaining Stage-2 gate is
S-006's.

## Cross-Cutting Notes (read before reviewing individual domains)

1. **Owner-ratified inputs are binding, not re-litigated.** D4 = codegen dev bin (schema.json
   stays hand-authored, parsed as data, no postinstall, project-scoped writes, explicit
   invocation), the reserved-name namespace split (schematic-level `pre-execute`/`post-execute`
   here vs. collection-level `add`/`remove` deferred to L2), and the interim-throw
   resolution (final shape only, via coordinated Stage-2 amendment) are inputs to this
   spec, not open questions.
2. **ADR-0018 scoping (council arch-F1).** ADR-0018 ("the SDK never validates") governs
   WIRE-level judgments at the `EngineClient` port — paths, serializability, intra-batch
   conflicts — which stay engine-owned pass-through. `run-boundary-input-validation`'s
   schema-conformance checking is the author's OWN input contract, upstream of the wire,
   and out of ADR-0018's scope. Design MUST produce a formal scoping/amendment ADR for
   ADR-0018 recording this distinction before the pre-archive architecture audit — without
   it, the audit gate halts `architecture-audit-violations`. The REQs in
   `run-boundary-input-validation` assume this scoping holds; they do not themselves
   constitute the ADR. Path-shaped input VALUES pass through to engine-owned wire
   validation untouched by this scoping change (SEC-m1) — deliberate, not an omission.
3. **Interim throw shape — see the consolidated "Interim Behaviour" section above** (was:
   a per-domain repeated note in V1; consolidated per BA-1/QA-M1 so it is stated once and
   referenced, not re-explained per domain).
4. **Reserved-name enforcement site (council arch-F3).** `defineFactory` only ever receives
   `fn` — it cannot see sibling module exports at runtime. `REQ-RLN-01` therefore requires
   enforcement to observe the factory package's OWN MODULE STRUCTURE (build-time static
   scan, or an inspectable lifecycle-hooks API — design decides which); no site that
   cannot see module structure satisfies this REQ. The exact declaration shape is
   design-gated (REQ-RLN-01, Scenario .1) — the reservation and enforcement obligation are
   not.
5. **bin→core dependency direction (council arch-F4).** The codegen bin lives outside the
   `src/` runtime path; it may depend on shared schema logic in `src/core`, never the
   reverse. `REQ-FPS-03`/FIT-15 is the new structural guard.
6. **FIT numbering.** Stage 2 claims FIT-11 (concurrent build). This change claims
   FIT-12 (parity), FIT-13 (sufficiency), FIT-14 (package-surface guard), FIT-15
   (bin→core dependency direction) — no collision.
7. **RED posture** (Stage-1/Stage-2 four-posture convention): `REQ-SCP-01` (parity gate,
   now digest-mechanism) is **must-fail-first** — no parity/drift check exists today.
   `REQ-TFO-01`/`REQ-RBV-01` are **must-fail-first** against today's bare-generic,
   zero-validation `defineFactory`. `REQ-TFO-02`/`REQ-RLN-03` are **characterization**
   (proving already-intended backward-compatible/boundary behaviour, not a bug fix).
   `REQ-RLN-01`'s Scenario .1 is **design-gated** — it cannot be driven red until the
   declaration-mechanism ADR lands; Scenarios .2–.4 are must-fail-first now.

## Next Step

Surface V2 to human for review (owner sign-off). If approved, orchestrator marks
status=signed and proceeds to `sdd-design`. If feedback given, orchestrator re-invokes
`sdd-spec` with feedback. Do NOT sign at V2 per this task's instruction.
